	  [servers] section.  Also add new section about how GDM supports

	  section supporting commands which GDM does not support.  Now more
	  consistantly use the word attached display instead of local or

2007-06-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.19.2
	* C/gdm.xml: Rewrote the "gdmdynamic Command Line Options"
	  section to fix a problem with xml2po crashing while trying to
	  process the file.  This problem was caused because some of the
	  <varlistentry> items did not have values for the <term> tag,
	  which seemed to make xml2po unhappy.  Rewording this section
	  avoids this problem.  Updated to the new release version.

2007-05-14  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml:  Add mdash and percnt entities so that make
	  stops complaining.  Probably a better way to do this since these

	  &quote; typo, changing to &quot;.
	* C/Makefile.am: Clean up a bit.

2007-05-14  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* */Makefile.am:  Delete these files.  They aren't needed.
	  Update to no longer use the deprecated xmldocs.make and omf.make.
	  Now gnome-doc-utils.make handles everything.

	  mentioned.

2007-04-05  Lukasz Zalewski <lukas@dcs.qmul.ac.uk>

	* C/gdm.xml: Added a "Themed with face browser" option to the

	  date, and some new information needed to be added (like
	  that you don't need to create a writable gdm home directory
	  starting with GNOME 2.18).

2007-03-23  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Add new XnestUnscaledFontPath key to docs.  Fix
	  Configuration section to refer to the configuration file by name
	  rather than repeating the full path over and over.  Now that we
	  support Xephyr, change docs to refer to "nested Xserver" or "nested
	  display" rathar than referring to this feature as "Xnest".  Added
	  some docs to the PAM section.  Other cleanup of wording.

	  documented.

	  directories are mounted via NFS/NIS, etc.

2005-09-14  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	  some.

2005-08-22  Tommi Vainikainen  <thv@iki.fi>

	* C/gdm.xml, gdm.1: Fixed address of the web site.

2005-08-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Updated Face Browser docs to better explain how things
	  work now that bug #310906 has been fixed, and to clarify that the
	  Face Browser can be used with the Themed Greeter.

2005-08-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Updated links to point to the new
	  http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/ for the project page.  Updated

	  art.gnome.org link.

2005-08-11  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Documented new default "auto" option for Use24Clock,

	  changes:

	  See the Language chapter in GNOME HIG for more information.

2005-04-25  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	  Laurent Birtz.

2005-04-22  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* C/gdm.xml: document new config keys.

2005-04-19  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml:  Now support ratio scaling of SVG images.  Docs were not
	  provided with the patch so I added some.  Fixes bug 159524.  Patch
	  provided by Vincent Untz <vincent@vuntz.net>.  Also fixed spelling.
	* C/gdm.xml: Fixed bug 300138 by providing better sound docs in the
	  a11y section.  Fixes bug #300138.  Patch provided by Andrew Case.

2005-04-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Add login success/failure sounds.  Patch provided by
	  Andrew Case.  Refer to bug #300136.

2005-04-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Add docs for DefaultWelcome and DefaultRemoteWelcome
	  keys and the ability to allow theming of background colors in
	  the Face Browser.

2005-03-23  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml:  Add face browser tab for configuring the face browser
	  with the Exclude options and the new Include and IncludeAll
	  configuration options.

Fri Mar 18 21:45:0000 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* C/gdm.xml:  Added OK button to greeter so GDM now properly follows
	  the Sun HCI recommendations.  Fixes bug #98470.

Thu Mar 17 2:06:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* C/gdm.xml:  Made face browser much less braindead.  The facebrowser
	  is no longer insensitive when entering the password so you can
	  change the selected user without having to enter an invalid
	  password.  Also added a cancel button which allows user to reselect
	  a different username without having to enter an invalid password.
	  Removed the stupid double-click requirement to select a user with
	  the face browser.  Now just clicking on a user takes you to password
	  entry.  Clicking the cancel button unselects all users in the face
	  browser and takes the user back to the Username prompt.

Mon Mar 14 12:10:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* C/gdm.xml:  Added Include and IncludeAll gdm config options to
	  better control what users are displayed in the face browser.

Thu Mar 10 17:50:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Document the face that the default face directory is
	  changed to EXPANDED_DATADIR/pixmaps/faces since putting the faces
	  subdirectory in pixmaps simply makes more sense.  Also document
	  changes to the way GDM files are installed.  Now all programs
	  intended to be run by root are in EXPANDED_SBINDIR
	  (gdm/gdm-binary/gdmsetup), all programs that are not intended to be
	  run by end-users are in EXPANDED_LIBEXEC
	  (gdmchooser/gdmgreeter/gdmlogin).  Removed gdmconfig wrapper script
	  and gdmXnest symlink since they only server to clutter the
	  filesystem.  

Mon Feb 14 16:42:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Fixes bug #151018.  Add configuration option to disallow
	  visible feedback in password entry.  Patch provided by John
	  Martinsson.

Thu Aug 26 15:55:00 2004  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Updated docs to include gdmflexiserver command options,
 	  arguments for all GDM programs aside from gdm-binary (which was
	  already there), added accessibility section, and cleaned up the XML
	  so it is more readible.  Also added a comment that gdmlogin now lets
	  you change the theme from the menu.

Wed Jul 14 09:37:25 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Document the new CheckDirOwner key to fix systems
	  which have non-user-owned home dirs.

Tue Jul 13 10:27:35 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Add mention that VTAllocation now works on FreeBSD as
	  well.

Wed May 26 18:23:14 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.xml:  Add a daemon/ConsoleCannotHandle key which lists
	  languages which should not be used on the console because they
	  will not work.  Uses "C" locale strings instead then.  Should
	  "fix" #135387, but I suppose there's no clean way to do this,
	  just let the distributors ship proper config files and have them
	  test it (yeah right).  I've tested the current set on RH9 and I
	  listed all of the ones that didn't work.

Fri Apr 16 16:02:53 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: update version information, no changes.  I should have
	  done this before the release.

	  not 2.4

Fri Dec 12 17:56:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Add a GO fifo SOP command and a --wait-for-go command
	  line option.  This is intended to allow an initialization script to
	  start X early and have that be the GDM display, but not allow users
	  to log in until it's ready.

Fri Dec 12 17:14:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: There's now the ability to reap flexiservers that are

	* C/gdm.xml: Move the built in sessions to a more appropriate place
	  (datadir).  Apply a patch from Anton Altaparmakov to add an optional
	  info message to the greeters.  Fixes #125219

Wed Dec 10 2003 Archana Shah <archana.shah@wipro.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: Add documentation for Multicast and Multicast_Addr.

Mon Oct 06 15:02:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, gdm.1: add a very simple man page

Wed Aug 20 12:13:04 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: minor updates

Mon Aug 18 11:02:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	To prevent a possible DoS attack where an app might spit out
	too many warnings on stdout/stderr and thus fill up the users
	home dir (or when an app is buggy), the output of the session
	no longer goes directly into .xsession-errors but in fact
	through an internal pipe.  This way we can just cap the file
	at some size (currently 80*2500 bytes, which should be long
	enough for actual use in debugging but it's short enough to
	prevent a DoS attack)

	* C/gdm.xml: note about the above

Fri Aug 15 12:36:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: added more notes on the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 authorization

	* C/gdm.xml: fill in missing info in the theme manual

Thu Aug 07 17:59:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  sections a bit, whack SessionMaxFile entry

Wed Aug 06 17:40:27 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.xml: more notes on security of XDMCP and using
	  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 added, plus a section on the TCP Wrappers,
	  though it kind of sucks.

	* Makefile.am: Actually include the docs dir in the tarball and redo
	  the .96 release (doh!)

Wed Jun 11 16:04:02 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am: Actually include the theme document, DUH!

Fri Jun 06 19:07:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* C/gdm.(xml|sgml):  PingInterval is now in seconds.  It really makes
	  no sense in minutes, I mean who wants to use a connection which
	  hangs for several minutes, that makes no sense.  This fixes a whole
	  bunch of bugs, among others #103266

2003-04-10 Niall Power <Niall.Power@Sun.COM>

	* C/gdm.xml: Add support for launching gdmlogin/gdmgreeter with a
